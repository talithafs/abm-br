## /abm

Repast Simphony project (in Java). Folders were automatically generated by Eclipse Oxigen 3. The most relevant among them are:

1. **src/abm**: Contains the model itself - agents, links (relationships), markets, etc.
2. **input**: Three .csv files that the Java program uses as input. Those were generated by `/initialization/paper.rmd`. 
  1. *dist_fir.csv*: Distribution of firms by size (number of employees)
  2. *dist_inc.csv*: Distribution of income among consumers
  3. *parameters*: Other parameters of the model, such as GDP, number of agents, etc.
3. **output**: Each .csv contains the series that are necessary to calculate a given stylized fact about general economies. Two words of caution: (i) I delete these files regularly, and (ii) I'm not yet entirely sure the series are being correctly calculated. 
4. **tests**: Unit tests - some of them are outdated, because they were designed for earlier versions of the model
5.
